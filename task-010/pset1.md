# CS50 WEEK 1 
</p> Through the cs50 week 1 lecure i got introduced to the programming language c.</p>
</p> Its my first time working with c . I only knew python before this which i studied during my higher secondary school education.</p>
</p> I learned the basics of c through the week 1 lecture and it was really intersting. </p>
<p>I also completed pset1 which was fun and easy to do. </p>
