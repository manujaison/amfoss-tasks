I downloaded the Ubuntu 20.04.3 ISO file from the official site.
Then i downloaded Rufus to set up a bootable pendrive from which i can installl ubunutu.
After I downloaded Ubuntu, using Rufus, I copied the ISO file to the pendrive.
I booted the pen drive from the boot menu using f12 key.
I installed ubuntu, selecting my preferences.
Luckily I didn't encounter any error while installing ubuntu.
It wasn't as hard as i thought.
