# INTROSPECTION
<h3>Why must we choose you?</p>
<p>In 11 th and 12 th I chose Computer Science just beacuse i hated Biology. When i started studying coding i enjoyed doing it so much and i knew this is my thing and i am gonna make a living out of it. While I am coding I never fell like doing some work or putting some effort eventhough i am doing it for hours it always feel like having fun . I just want to learn more than just acdemic stuff. Learning new stuff is something I always enjoy especially in the field of tech. I think after seeing my interest in coding and learning new stuff amFOSS can consider choosing me. </p>
<h3>What is your plan for the next six months?</p>
<p></p>
<h3>How would you contribute back to the club?</h3>
<p>I would try my best to do whatever the club wants from me.</p>
<h3>Do you have any feedback for the selection process?</h3>
<p>The selection process was great. At first when I saw the tasks I thought I couldn't do anything but I ended up doing more than I expected. It was a really good leaning ecperience.I learned a lot of new things from this selection process and i am grateful to amFOSS for providing me this opportunity. </p>
