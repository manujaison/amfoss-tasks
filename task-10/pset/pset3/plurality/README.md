# PLURALITY
<p> Plurality takes a sequence of votes as input and outputs the winner of the election.</p>
<p>I used an userdifined data structure called candidate to store the name and the number of votes each candidate recieved.</p>
<p>Solving this program was really hard for me and i also encountered a lot of error while doing it.</p>
