# CAESER
<p> Caeser is a program used to encrypt the information the user inputs by shifting each letter som number of places that the user wants.</p>
<p>This problem was difficult for me but i managed to do it after watching the walkthrough video by the cs50 staff. </p>
<p>First the program gets the key which is the amount of places we should shift each character.I used an if loop to ensure that an integer value is given for the key by the user else it prompts the user till an integer value is given. <p>
<p>Then the program inputs a plaintext from the user and outputs the ciphertext whose each character is shifted by a certain amount of places.</p> 
<p>I used a combination of for and if loops to shift each character./<p>
