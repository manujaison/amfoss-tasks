# READABILITY
<p> Readability is program that inputs some text from the user and accesses the aproximate reading level of the text.</p>
<p>In this program Coleman-Liau Index is used to calculate the readability of the inputed text.</p>
<p>I used a for loop to calculate the number of words, sentences and letters.</p>
<p>Then used the coleman-lianu index to calucalated the readability</p>
<p>The walkthrough by cs50 staffs helped me a lot in solving this problem</p>
