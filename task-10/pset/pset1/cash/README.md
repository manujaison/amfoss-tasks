# CASH
<p> Cash is a program that asks how much change is owed and suggests the minimum number of coins with which that change can be made.</p>
<p> I used a do while loop to prompt the user till a postive float number is inputed. </p>
<p>I used several for loops to find the minimum number of coins .</p>
<p> It was fun to do this task.</p>
