# MARIO
<p> I did the more comfortable version of mario which input the height of the pyramid <p from the user and prints its in the left and right side.</p>
<p>I used a do while loop and several for loops to solve this problem.</p>
<p> If the height inputed is not between 1 and 8 inclusive it prompts for the uder to input again, till the user inputs a value between 1 and 8 inclusive .This was done uding the do while loop.</p>
<p> To print the hashes i used for loops.</p>
<p>This problem was easy for me.</p>
