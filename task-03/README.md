# PROGRAMMING

<p> I used python to solve this becuase i felt more comfortable with python. I have learned python basics in my 11 th and 12 th std.</p>
<p> At first when i read the questions , I felt like i couldn'nt solve any of those. </p>
<p> At first i felt struck and like not reaching anywhere but after trying for long and encountering with many errors i was able to solve some of the questions.</p>
<p> When i solved a question that i thought i couldn'nt solve it gave me confidence to try out other qustions.</p>
<p> This task took patience as i had to try again and again .</p>
