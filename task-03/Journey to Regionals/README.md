<p>In this problem we had to find some from a strating point till the ending point. First i stored sum of all the ements till that position in the list.</p>
<p>Then to find the sum from a starting point till ending point i subtracted the sum before the strating point from the sum till the ending point.</p>
<p>This is how i solved this problem.</p>
