<p>I inputed the powers of programmers and developers and sorted it .</p>
<p>Then compared the power of programmers with the developers.<p>
 <p>When the problem solvers could kill all the developrs i printed yes and the power of the problem solvers used then ended the program using exit command.<p>
<p>If the problem solvers couldn't kill all the developers it will print no.</p>
