<p>When i first read the problem i was so happy because it was so simple. <p>
<p>Then i did it and submitted it was terminated due to time out then i tried using while loop then also same thing happened .I even tried to code in c and c++ thinking  maybe the error was there because python was slow.
</p>
<p>Then i tried to run the loop till square root of n and my submission was finally accepted.I used python because i am more familiar with it.</p>
