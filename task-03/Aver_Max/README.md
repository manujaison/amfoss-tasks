<p> In this problem we have to input a string and the number of times its sign can be changed and output the maximum average possible for a chosen subset. </p>
<p> The maximum average possible for a chosen subset of amy size from a list of numbers is the greatest number in that list. If the number of times we can change the sign is greater than 0 and the absolute value of the minimum number which is  a negative number is greater than the absolute value of the greatest number then it is the maximum average possible.I used this logic to solve this problem.</p><p> Eventhough it was a bit tricky this problem  was the easiest to solve for me. </p>
